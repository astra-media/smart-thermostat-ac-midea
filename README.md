# Smart Thermostat for Midea MAT12R1YWT Air Conditioner â€“ IoT Project

## About this Project

This IoT project enables users to remotely control the temperature and power state of the **Midea MAT12R1YWT** air conditioner without modifying the A/Câ€™s control unitâ€”making it a non-invasive, safe, and energy-efficient solution.

Built on the **Arduino IoT Cloud** and powered by an **ESP32 development board**, the system is designed for both local and remote operation. The code includes **Alexa-compatible variables**, allowing control via **Amazon Alexa** voice commands.

Thanks to the ESP32â€™s **dual-core CPU**, the project can run two concurrent loops: one core handles cloud services and user input, while the other manages the A/Câ€™s logic based on user-defined settings. This allows for smooth performance without interruptions.

Additional features include:

* **"Follow Me" mode** â€“ sends the temperature detected by a **DHT11 sensor** to the A/C, emulating the original remoteâ€™s sensor feature.
* **"Away Mode"** â€“ automatically turns the A/C on or off if the space becomes too hot, helping conserve energy.

> ðŸ”§ Note: The code also includes variables for other devices not described in this section.

## Operation

The A/C is controlled via **infrared (IR) remote commands**, using the `IRremoteESP8266` library and its high-level `IRMideaAC` class. This allows for **stateful control** (like an actual remote) rather than sending raw hexadecimal codes.

The ESP32 uses:

* An **IR LED** to transmit commands,
* A **DHT11 sensor** to monitor room temperature, and
* An **LCD** to display system status.

**Push-buttons** are also included for manual, local control of the A/C unit.
